Output: When the user resizes the browser window, a random number is displayed in the paragraph element. This demonstrates how you can use the addEventListener() method on the window object to listen for the "resize" event and trigger a custom event handler function in response. By attaching event listeners to the window object, you can create interactive behaviors that respond to changes in the browser environment, such as resizing the window. The addEventListener() method is a versatile tool for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows developers to define custom event handlers and respond to user actions in a flexible and efficient manner. By attaching event listeners to specific elements on the page, developers can create interactive features that enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging and responsive. The addEventListener() method is supported by all modern web browsers and is the recommended approach for handling events in JavaScript. It is part of the DOM Events API, which provides a standardized way to work with events in web applications. The addEventListener() method is preferred over the traditional "on" event attributes (e.g., onclick, onmouseover) because it provides better separation of concerns and allows for more flexibility and control over event handling. The addEventListener() method allows for multiple event listeners to be attached to the same element, enabling more complex interactions and behaviors.
