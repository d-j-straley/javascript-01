<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Output: When the user clicks on the "Try it" button, the color of all p elements on the page will change from green to red, or from red to green. 
 
 The provided HTML file demonstrates how to use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML DOM by changing the color of all <p> elements on the page when a button is clicked. The document starts with the standard <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by the opening <html> and <body> tags. Within the body, there is a heading (<h2>JavaScript HTML DOM</h2>) and three paragraphs (<p>) with some text.

A button with the text "Try it" is provided, and when clicked, it triggers the myFunction() JavaScript function.

The script section contains the following JavaScript code:

A global variable color is initialized with the value "green".

The myFunction() function is defined. This function:

Retrieves all <p> elements on the page using document.getElementsByTagName("p") and stores them in the myCollection variable.
Checks the current value of the color variable. If it is "green", it changes the value to "red". Otherwise, it changes the value back to "green".
Calls the changeColor() function, passing myCollection and the updated color as arguments.
The changeColor() function is defined. This function:

Takes two parameters: myCollection (a collection of <p> elements) and color (the color to change to).
Iterates over the myCollection using a for loop and sets the style.color property of each <p> element to the specified color.
When the button is clicked, the myFunction() function is executed, which toggles the color of all <p> elements between green and red. This example demonstrates how to use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the HTML DOM to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript HTML DOM</h2>

<p>Hello #1</p>

<p>Hello #2</p>

<p>Click the button to change the color of all p elements.  
  Except that this time we use a different function: document.quertySelectorAll() 
</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<script>

let color = "blue";

function myFunction() {
  const myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll("p");

  if (color === "blue") 
  {
    color = "purple";
  } 
  else 
  {
    color = "blue";
  }
  changeColor(myNodeList, color);
}

function changeColor(myNodeList, color) {

  for (let i = 0; i < myNodeList.length; i++) {
    myNodeList[i].style.color = color;
  }
}
</script>

</body>
