Output: When the user hovers over the button, the message "Moused over!" is displayed in the paragraph element below the button. When the user clicks on the button, the message "Clicked!" is added to the paragraph. Finally, when the user moves the mouse away from the button, the message "Moused out!" is appended to the paragraph.
This demos how you can use the addEventListener() method to attach multiple event listeners to the same element, allowing for different actions to be triggered in response to different events. By defining separate event handler functions for each event type, you can create interactive behaviors that respond to user input in a variety of ways.
The addEventListener() method is a versatile tool for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows developers to define custom event handlers and respond to user actions in a flexible and efficient manner. By attaching event listeners to specific elements on the page, developers can create interactive features that enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging and responsive.
The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event listener to an element, listening for a specific event (e.g., "click", "mouseover", "keydown").

<h2>JavaScript addEventListener()</h2>

<p>This example uses the addEventListener() method to add many events on the same button.</p>

<button id="myBtn">Try it</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = document.getElementById("myBtn");
x.addEventListener("mouseover", myFunction);
x.addEventListener("click", mySecondFunction);
x.addEventListener("mouseout", myThirdFunction);

function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused over!<br>";
}

function mySecondFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Clicked!<br>";
}

function myThirdFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused out!<br>";
}
</script>
