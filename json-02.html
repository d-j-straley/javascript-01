<!-- The provided HTML code demonstrates how to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object and display one of its properties on a webpage. The HTML structure includes a <body> tag that contains a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph (<p>) with an ID of "demo". This paragraph is where the result will be displayed.

Within the <script> tags, a JSON string is defined and assigned to the constant myJSON. This JSON string represents an object with three properties: "name", "age", and "city". The JSON.parse() method is then used to convert this JSON string into a JavaScript object, which is stored in the constant myObj.

Finally, the code uses document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML to access the paragraph element with the ID "demo" and sets its inner HTML to the value of the "name" property of the myObj object. As a result, the name "John" is displayed in the paragraph on the webpage. This example illustrates the basic process of parsing JSON data and manipulating the DOM to display the parsed data. -->

<h2>Convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object.</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
const myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name + ", " + myObj.age;
</script>
