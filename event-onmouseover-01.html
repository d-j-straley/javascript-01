<!-- The onmouseover attribute is used to trigger a function when the user moves the mouse over an element. -->
<!-- The mOver() function is triggered when the mouse pointer is moved over the <div> element. It sets the innerHTML of the <div> element to "Thank You". -->   
<!-- The mOut() function is triggered when the mouse pointer is moved out of the <div> element. It sets the innerHTML of the <div> element to "Mouse Over Me". -->
<!-- The onmouseover attribute is supported in all major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. -->
<!-- The onmouseover attribute is often used together with the onmouseout attribute to create a change effect when the mouse moves over an element. -->
<!-- The onmouseover attribute is similar to the onmouseenter attribute. -->
<!-- The difference is that the onmouseenter attribute does not bubble up the DOM hierarchy, while the onmouseover attribute does. -->
<!-- The onmouseover attribute is often used together with the onmouseout attribute to create a change effect when the mouse moves over an element. -->
