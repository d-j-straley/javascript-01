<!-- In this example, the form-02.html file contains a simple form with a single text input field and a submit button. The input field has the "required" attribute, which specifies that the field must be filled out before the form can be submitted. If the user clicks the submit button without entering any text, the browser will display an error message indicating that the field is required. This is a basic example of client-side form validation using HTML. -->
