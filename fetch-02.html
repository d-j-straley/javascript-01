/*
check out this syntax!  This accomplishes the same thing as my
previous example, but in a more concise way.  The fetch() method
is used to fetch a resource from the network.  It returns a promise
that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful
or not.  You can also define a default value to return if the promise
is rejected.
Note that this function is not declared as async, and does not use
the await keyword.  This is because the fetch() method is already
asynchronous, and returns a promise.  The then() method is used to
handle the promise returned by the fetch() method. 
In other words, this is the same end-result as if it were
to use async and await, but it is done in a more concise way.
It's like saying:
1.) fetch the file and put the result into an object called x
2.) take the text from x and put it into an object called y
3.) put the text from y into the element with the id of "demo".
Pretty crazy.

fetch (file)
.then(x => x.text())
.then(y => document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y);
