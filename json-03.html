<!-- The provided HTML code demonstrates how to fetch a JSON file using the XMLHttpRequest object and display one of its properties on a webpage. The HTML structure includes a <body> tag that contains a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph (<p>) with an ID of "demo". This paragraph is where the result will be displayed.

Within the <script> tags, an instance of XMLHttpRequest is created and assigned to the constant xmlhttp. The onload event handler is defined for this xmlhttp object, which specifies what should happen when the request is successfully completed. Inside this event handler, the response text (which is expected to be a JSON string) is parsed into a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(), and the resulting object is stored in the constant myObj.

The code then uses document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML to access the paragraph element with the ID "demo" and sets its inner HTML to the value of the "name" property of the myObj object. This means that when the JSON file is successfully fetched and parsed, the name property from the JSON data will be displayed in the paragraph on the webpage.

To initiate the request, the xmlhttp.open("GET", "json_demo.txt") method is called, specifying the HTTP method "GET" and the URL of the JSON file ("json_demo.txt"). Finally, the xmlhttp.send() method is called to send the request. This example illustrates the process of making an asynchronous HTTP request to fetch JSON data and manipulating the DOM to display the parsed data. -->

<!-- Here is <json_demo class="txt">
  {
    "name":"John",
    "age":31,
    "pets":[
        { "animal":"dog", "name":"Fido" },
        { "animal":"cat", "name":"Felix" },
        { "animal":"hamster", "name":"Lightning" }
    ]
} -->
