Yes, you can also use an arrow function to create the anonymous function. Both function() and arrow functions () => can be used to create anonymous functions, but there are some differences between them.

Using function():
Using Arrow Function:
Pros and Cons:
function():
Pros:

Has its own this context, which can be useful in certain situations.
Can be used as a constructor.
Can have its own arguments object.
Cons:

More verbose syntax compared to arrow functions.
Arrow Function (() =>):
Pros:

Shorter and more concise syntax.
Does not have its own this context; it inherits this from the surrounding scope, which can be useful to avoid issues with this in nested functions.
Does not have its own arguments object; it inherits arguments from the surrounding scope.
Cons:

Cannot be used as a constructor.
May be less intuitive for developers who are not familiar with the differences in this context.
Example with Arrow Function:
Summary:
Use function() if you need the function to have its own this context or if you need to use it as a constructor.
Use arrow functions for shorter syntax and when you want to inherit this from the surrounding scope.
Both approaches will work for your setTimeout example, and the choice depends on your specific use case and preference.


Example with Arrow Function:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>JavaScript Functions</h1>
<h2>setTimeout() with a Callback</h2>

<p>Wait 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds) for this page to change.</p>

<h1 id="demo"></h1>

<script>
setTimeout(() => {
  alert("Timeout reached");
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I love You !!!";
}, 3000);
</script>

</body>
</html>

Use function() if you need the function to have its own this context or if you need to use it as a constructor.
