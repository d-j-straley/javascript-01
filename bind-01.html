<!-- The provided HTML code demonstrates how to use the JavaScript `bind()` function to ensure that a method retains the correct `this` context when invoked later. The HTML structure includes a heading that introduces the topic, a paragraph explaining that a person's name will be displayed after 3 seconds, and another paragraph with an ID of "demo" where the result will be shown.

Within the `<script>` tags, a `person` object is defined with two properties, `firstName` and `lastName`, and a method named `display`. The `display` method is responsible for retrieving the HTML element with the ID "demo" and setting its inner HTML to the full name of the person by accessing `this.firstName` and `this.lastName`. This method relies on the `this` keyword to refer to the `person` object.

To ensure that the `display` method retains the correct `this` context when called after a delay, the `bind()` function is used. The line `let display = person.display.bind(person);` creates a new function `display` that is permanently bound to the `person` object. This means that when the `display` function is called, the `this` keyword inside the function will always refer to the `person` object, regardless of how or when the function is invoked.

Finally, the `setTimeout` function is used to call the `display` function after a delay of 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). This results in the full name "John Doe" being displayed in the paragraph with the ID "demo" after 3 seconds. This example effectively illustrates how the `bind()` function can be used to maintain the correct `this` context in JavaScript functions, ensuring that methods behave as expected even when their execution is deferred. -->

<h1>JavaScript Function bind()</h1>

<p>This example will display a person name after 3 seconds:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const person = {
  firstName:"Jan",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function() {
    let x = document.getElementById("demo");
    x.innerHTML = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

let display = person.display.bind(person);
setTimeout(display, 3000);
</script>
