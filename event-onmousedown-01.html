<!-- The onmousedown attribute is used to trigger a function when the user presses a mouse button over an element. -->
<!-- The mDown() function is triggered when the mouse button is pressed down over the <div> element. It sets the background color of the <div> element to "#1ec5e5" and the innerHTML to "Release Me". -->  
<!-- The mUp() function is triggered when the mouse button is released over the <div> element. It sets the background color of the <div> element to "#D94A38" and the innerHTML to "Thank You". -->
<!-- The onmousedown attribute is supported in all major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. -->
