<!-- The provided HTML file demonstrates the use of JavaScript timing functions to create a live clock that updates every second. The document starts with the standard <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by the opening <html> and <body> tags. Within the body, there is a heading (<h2>JavaScript Timing</h2>) and a paragraph explaining that a script on the page starts a clock.

The page contains:

A paragraph with the ID "demo" where the current time will be displayed.
A button with the text "Stop time" that, when clicked, stops the clock.
The script section contains the following JavaScript code:

A variable myVar is declared and initialized with the result of setInterval(myTimer, 1000). This sets up a timer that calls the myTimer function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

The myTimer function is defined. This function:

Creates a new Date object and stores it in the variable d.
Updates the inner HTML of the paragraph with the ID "demo" to display the current time using d.toLocaleTimeString().
The button's onclick attribute is set to clearInterval(myVar), which stops the interval timer when the button is clicked.

When the page loads, the setInterval function starts the myTimer function, which updates the time displayed in the "demo" paragraph every second. Clicking the "Stop time" button stops the timer, preventing further updates to the displayed time. This example demonstrates how to use JavaScript timing functions to create a live clock and how to stop it if needed. -->
