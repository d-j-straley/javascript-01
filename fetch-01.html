<!-- The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource from the network. It returns a promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. You can also define a default value to return if the promise is rejected.

The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.

You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument (see Request) that allows you to control a number of different settings:  

method: The request method, e.g., GET, POST.
headers: Any headers you want to add to your request, contained within a Headers object or an object literal with ByteString values.
body: Any body that you want to add to your request: this can be a Blob, BufferSource, FormData, URLSearchParams, ReadableStream, or USVString object. Note that a request using the GET or HEAD method cannot have a body.
mode: The mode you want to use for the request, e.g., cors, no-cors, same-origin, or navigate.
credentials: The request credentials you want to use for the request: omit, same-origin, or include. To automatically send cookies for the current domain, this option must be provided. This is a RequestCredentials object.
cache: The cache mode you want to use for the request: default, no-store, reload, no-cache, force-cache, or only-if-cached.
redirect: The redirect mode to use: follow (automatically follow redirects), error (abort with an error if a redirect occurs), or manual (handle redirects manually). In Chrome the default is follow (before Chrome 47 it defaulted to manual).
referrer: Specifies the value of the referer HTTP header.
referrerPolicy: Specifies the value of the referrerPolicy attribute.
integrity: Contains the subresource integrity value of the request (e.g., sha256-BpfBzqfzqf).
keepalive: The keepalive option can be used to allow the request to outlive the page.
signal: An AbortSignal object instance; allows you to communicate with a fetch request and abort it if desired via an AbortController.
window: A WindowProxy object.
The fetch() method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. You can also define a default value to return if the promise is rejected.

The then() method is used to handle the promise returned by the fetch() method. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise. Each callback receives the Response object representing the response to the request.

The catch() method is used to handle the promise returned by the fetch() method when it rejects. It takes one argument: a callback function to run if the promise is rejected, i.e., if the request fails for some reason.

The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. An asynchronous function is a function which operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result. But the syntax and structure of your code using async functions is much more like using standard synchronous functions.

The await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected), and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise. -->
